<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Romford Times, Wednesday, 1 December 1948</h2>
<article class="article">
  <p class="govuk-body">For Mr Rutherford, a coach driver based at Brentwood, first of the permanent house tenants at Harold Hill, this change of address will not only mean more living room, but an appreciable easing up in his daily routine. While he has been living at Becontree, Mr. Rutherford has been getting up at 2.30 a.m. each day to be at work by 4.50 a.m. Near his work now, he can rise later. The Rutherfords, with one son and three daughters, will move in on Saturday morning. Two other sons are at present in the Forces, and one daughter is in the Women’s Land Army. Their former home, a five-room cottage, will now be occupied by another family in urgent need of accommodation who wish to live at Becontree.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">‘A Lovely Home’</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Their house is No. 44 Gooshays, a large tree-lined avenue running north through the estate opposite Gubbins-lane. One of the larger types of house being erected on Harold Hill, it is described by Mrs. Rutherford as ‘a lovely home’; it has a living room, sitting room and three bedrooms, kitchen (115 sq. ft.), and an additional water closet on the ground off the rear entrance lobby. Heating in the living room is by an open fire, fitted with a back boiler to provide hot water supply, and with connector flues to warm a number of other rooms. Other amenities include space for a perambulator and fuel and tool stores.</p>
